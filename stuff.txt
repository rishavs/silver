    'Everyday life is hard for Tate, especially making friends. He likes to play with spinning tops all the time, which is uncommon for a third grader. A new classmate of his, Logan, can tell that Tate is different, that thereâ€™s something very special about him.
Together, they discover the unimaginable: Tates top can transport them to different dimensions, where they meet unexpected friends and experience fun adventures together.
Tate has difficulty making friends because his autism makes him different. But an unexpected adventure with a new classmate could be the start of something great.
Tates top transports him and Logan to the Mesozoic Era when dinosaurs ruled the Earth! They are excited, but also scared. Hopefully, they can have a little fun and not become the lunchtime special!
The boys spin the top in a creative way at recess. But, instead of time traveling backward, they find themselves in a future world!
The top takes Tate and Logan to ancient Egypt where they encounter exciting yet unfamiliar features of the Egyptian life, including hieroglyphics, pharaohs and pyramids.
Tate and Logan have forged a great friendship, but when Logan asks Tate to meet his other friends, Tates insecurities creep up again.', 'authid01', 'Dan Simmons')

    This is one of the most common issues people run into in Crystal. It is because instance variables (in this case status) must be assigned to a local variable first, or use try. So you can do something like store.status.try do |status| and then check status == "error"
It would be awesome if Crystal gave you an error because it is nearly impossible to figure out without reading it in the docs or someone telling you
Luckily once you know about it it is pretty easy to workaround :)
More info here: https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/if_var.html under "Limitations"
Or actually you might need store.try since it appears to also be nilable
Also, I'd consider not allowing status and message to be nil and instead make just the store billable. So if the store is there, it always has a status and message
